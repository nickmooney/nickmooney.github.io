My name is Nick. I'm taking some time away from information security at the moment to dive, fly planes, and travel around a bit. I'm based in Auckland, New Zealand.

Before this break, I was a senior software engineer securing Google Cloud. At work I hunted bugs, helped product engineers develop threat modeling and adversarial thinking skills, and worked with product architects to make secure, sound architectural decisions as early in the engineering process as possible.

Before Google, I was a senior research engineer on the Labs team at Duo Security, and before Duo I attended the University of Washington in Seattle.
