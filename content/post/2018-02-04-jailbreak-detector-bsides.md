title: Jailbreak Detector Detector
---

I gave my first talk! Big thanks to the folks organizing BSides Seattle for putting on a great show. It was a real pleasure to speak to an engaged and interested audience, and I really enjoyed the other talks and activites.

The title of the talk is "Jailbreak Detector Detector: Countermeasures to jailbreak detection on iOS." It is mostly an overview of jailbreak detection techniques and the ways in which they are bypassed by end users. I discovered much of this while doing research on jailbreak detection at Duo. Shoutout to [/u/ryley\_angus](https://www.reddit.com/user/ryley_angus) -- I reversed their Liberty app to provide supporting material for the talk.

Slides can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ll54hqup927r7y1/Jailbreak%20Detector%20Detector.pdf?dl=0), and I'll be sure to link a video if one exists (not sure if the talks got recorded).
