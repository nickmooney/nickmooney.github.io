I am a senior research engineer on the [Labs](https://duo.com/labs) team at [Duo Security](https://duo.com/). I like security, code that has tangible effects in the real world, and code that is silly on purpose.

Before Duo, I attended the University of Washington where I got a B.S. in Computer Science.
