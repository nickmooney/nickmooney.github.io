I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Washington in Seattle. I like security, code that has tangible effects in the real world, and code that is silly on purpose.

### Old projects
Before college, I blogged [here](http://www.gnewt.at/blog/). Some of my favorite projects from that time are:

* [Node.js + Arduino + Raspberry Pi + Christmas lights](http://www.gnewt.at/blog/2013/09/christmas-lights-with-node-js-arduino-raspberry-pi/)
* [Bidirectional Caller ID Spoofing](http://www.gnewt.at/blog/2012/07/asterisk-bidirectional-cid-spoofing/)
* [Ordering a bunch of shirts with Django and Stripe](http://www.gnewt.at/blog/2014/04/bhs-shirt-sales-with-django/)
